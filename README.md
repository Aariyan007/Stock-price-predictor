Introduction
The Stock Price Predictor leverages historical stock price data to predict future stock prices using machine learning. This project focuses on the closing prices of Tesla Inc. (TSLA) from January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2023. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras libraries, and it employs an LSTM neural network to capture the temporal dependencies in the stock price data.

Features
Data Collection: Downloads historical stock price data using the yfinance library.
Data Preprocessing: Scales the data using MinMaxScaler and creates sequences for the LSTM model.
Model Architecture: Builds an LSTM neural network with multiple layers and dropout for regularization.
Training and Validation: Splits the data into training, validation, and test sets, and employs early stopping.
Evaluation and Prediction: Evaluates the model on the test set and makes predictions.
Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted stock prices.
